## PDF CONVERTER

Built using Laravel Lumen, Pdf converter is a simple api that converts html page to PDF by simply providing the url to the html file.

- Enter the url ```(54.169.224.54/convert) ```
- Add Post parameters ``` url = http:://urltohtmlsite```
- And a JSON response is sent e.g ``` {"url":"http:\/\/chargifly.blob.core.windows.net\/\/pdf-converter\/58e70c95244a6.pdf","status":200} ```

It really is that simple to use
